Connect Over CDP - Microsoft Playwright Service

Simple example showing how to connect to a remote browser via CDP.
This demonstrates a NON-TESTING scenario for manual browser automation.

----------------------------------------
📌 Prerequisites
----------------------------------------
1️⃣ Python environment with the following packages installed:
   pip install playwright aiohttp python-dotenv

2️⃣ Playwright Remote Browser Setup
   - Sign up for Microsoft Playwright Service.
   - Obtain your service URL and access token.
   - Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your values:

     PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL=wss://<region>.api.playwright.microsoft.com/playwrightworkspaces/<workspaceId>/browsers
     PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token

----------------------------------------
📌 How to Use
----------------------------------------
1️⃣ Run the script:
    python connectOverCDPScript.py

2️⃣ The script will:
   - Connect to the remote browser
   - Navigate to example.com
   - Take a screenshot
   - Extract page content
   - Click a link
