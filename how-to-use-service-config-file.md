# Use options available in service package with Playwright Workspaces

::: zone pivot="playwright-test-runner"

This article shows you how to use the options available in the `playwright.service.config.ts` file that was generated for you. 
If you don't have this file in your code, follow [Quickstart: Run end-to-end tests at scale with Playwright Workspaces](./quickstart-run-end-to-end-tests.md) 

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="nunit-test-runner"

This article shows you how to use the options available in the `.runsettings` file. 
If you don't have this file in your code, follow [Quickstart: Run end-to-end tests at scale with Playwright Workspaces](./quickstart-run-end-to-end-tests.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Playwright Workspaces is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

* Follow the Quickstart guide and set up a project to run with Playwright Workspaces. See, [Quickstart: Run end-to-end tests at scale with Playwright Workspaces Preview](./quickstart-run-end-to-end-tests.md) 

::: zone pivot="playwright-test-runner"

Below is a complete example of a `playwright.service.config.ts` file showing all supported configuration options:

```typescript
import { getServiceConfig, ServiceOS, ServiceAuth } from "@azure/playwright";
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";
import { AzureCliCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import config from "./playwright.config";

export default defineConfig(
  config,
  getServiceConfig(config, {
    serviceAuthType: ServiceAuth.ACCESS_TOKEN // Use this option if authenticating with access tokens. This mode of authentication must be explicitly enabled in your workspace.
    os: ServiceOS.WINDOWS, // Specify the browser's OS your tests will automate.
    runId: new Date().toISOString(), // Set a unique ID for every test run to distinguish them in the service portal.
    credential: new AzureCliCredential(), // Select the authentication method you want to use with Entra.
    useCloudHostedBrowsers: true, // Choose whether to use cloud-hosted browsers or the browsers on your client machine.
    exposeNetwork: '<loopback>', // Allows cloud browsers to access local resources from your Playwright test code without additional firewall config.
    timeout: 30000 // Set the timeout for your tests (in milliseconds).
  })
);

```

## Settings in `playwright.service.config.ts` file

* **`serviceAuthType`**:
    - **Description**: This setting allows you to choose the authentication method you want to use for your test run. 
    - **Available Options**:
        - `ServiceAuth.ACCESS_TOKEN` to use access tokens. You need to enable authentication using access tokens if you want to use this option, see [manage authentication](./how-to-manage-authentication.md).
        - `ServiceAuth.ENTRA_ID` to use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. It's the default mode. 
    - **Default Value**: `ServiceAuth.ENTRA_ID`
    - **Example**:
      ```typescript
      serviceAuthType: ServiceAuth.ENTRA_ID
      ```


* **`os`**:
    - **Description**: This setting allows you to choose the operating system where the browsers running Playwright tests are hosted.
    - **Available Options**:
        - `ServiceOS.WINDOWS` for Windows OS.
        - `ServiceOS.LINUX` for Linux OS.
    - **Default Value**: `ServiceOS.LINUX`
    - **Example**:
      ```typescript
      os: ServiceOS.WINDOWS
      ```

* **`runId`**:
    - **Description**: This setting allows you to set a unique ID for every test run to distinguish them in the service portal. Using the same runId for multiple test runs results in error. For sharding, keep this same across all shards.
    - **Example**:
      ```typescript
      runId: new Date().toISOString()
      ```

* **`credential`**:
    - **Description**: This setting allows you to select the authentication method you want to use with Microsoft Entra ID. You must specify this if `serviceAuthType` is **not** set to `ACCESS_TOKEN`.
    - **Example**:
      ```typescript
      credential: new AzureCliCredential()
      ```

* **`useCloudHostedBrowsers`**
    - **Description**: This setting allows you to choose whether to use cloud-hosted browsers or the browsers on your client machine to run your Playwright tests. If you disable this option, your tests run on the browsers of your client machine instead of cloud-hosted browsers, and you don't incur any charges.
    - **Default Value**: true
    - **Example**:
      ```typescript
      useCloudHostedBrowsers: true
      ```

* **`exposeNetwork`**
    - **Description**: This setting allows you to connect to local resources from your Playwright test code without having to configure another firewall settings. To learn more, see [how to test local applications](./how-to-test-local-applications.md)
    - **Example**:
      ```typescript
      exposeNetwork: '<loopback>'
      ```

* **`timeout`**
    - **Description**: This setting allows you to set timeout for your tests connecting to the cloud-hosted browsers. 
    - **Example**:
      ```typescript
      timeout: 30000,
      ```

        - `EntraId` to use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. It's the default mode. 
    - **Default Value**: `EntraId`
    - **Example**:
      ```xml
      <Parameter name="ServiceAuthType" value="EntraId" />
      ```

* **`os`**:
    - **Description**: This setting allows you to choose the operating system where the browsers running Playwright tests are hosted.

      <Parameter name="RunId" value="sample-run-id1" />
      ```
